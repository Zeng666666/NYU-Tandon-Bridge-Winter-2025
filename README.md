# NYU Tandon Bridge Winter 2025

This repository contains my work from the **NYU Tandon School of Engineering Bridge Program, Winter 2025**, which I successfully completed with **Distinction**.

I chose the **28-week** part-time track, which allowed me to complete the intensive program while working full-time. Although challenging, the experience was exciting and rewarding, and I truly enjoyed the material.

## Program Overview

The program is designed to build foundational technical skills for individuals without a technical background, preparing them to apply for select STEM graduate programs. Taught by NYU Tandon Computer Science faculty, this 100% online course covers discrete math, data structures and algorithms, and principles of operating systems.

A Certificate of Distinction is awarded to students who receive a B+ or higher, while a Certificate of Completion is awarded for a grade of C or higher.

## Program Objectives

Recipients of the NYU Tandon Bridge Certificate demonstrate the ability to:
* Basic understanding of how data is represented and how computers execute instructions to use and modify data in order to solve problems.
* Understanding of computational thinking: how to develop algorithms using decisions, repetition, and decomposition into manageable components to solve problems.
* Ability to implement and test moderate sized programs in C++, using constructs including variables, operators, decision statements, loops, functions, and built-in datatypes.
* Ability to understand basic object-oriented programming concepts.
* Ability to code, use, analyze the performance of, and modify fundamental data structures.
* Have a firm understanding of operating systems topics related to processes, threads, thread concurrency, deadlocks, and memory management.
* Understanding of fundamental concepts in discrete math.
