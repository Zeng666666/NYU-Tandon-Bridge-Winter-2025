#About Homeworks

I chose the 28-week part-time track, which allowed me to complete the program while working full-time. Although challenging, the experience was exciting and rewarding, and I truly enjoyed the material.

The program featured weekly assignments that included reading, coding, and discrete math problems. For discrete math, zyBooks was the primary resource, with all assignments coming directly from the textbook.

This folder contains all of my work for the program.
