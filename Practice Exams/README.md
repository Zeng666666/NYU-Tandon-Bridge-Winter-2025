# Practice Exams

Before each exam, the TA will post a Practice Problem Set on Ed Discussion. This document contains numerous questions designed for you to practice. The TA will then host a Zoom review session to go over these questions, giving you a great opportunity to ask about topics that are similar to what will be on the actual exam. This is where you can gain valuable problem-solving strategies and learn important concepts to help you succeed in your master's program.

Attendance at the review session is optional, and a recording will be provided.
