# Practice Exams

This folder contains the **practice problem sets** posted by the TA on Ed Discussion before each exam.

These documents are filled with questions designed to help you prepare. The TA will host a Zoom review session to go over the problems, giving you a great opportunity to ask questions about topics similar to those on the actual exam. This is an excellent way to gain valuable problem-solving strategies and learn important concepts that will help you succeed in your master's program.

Attendance at the review session is optional, and a recording will be provided.
